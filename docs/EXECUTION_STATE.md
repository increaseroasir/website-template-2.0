## Phase Status

- R0 Cursor readiness: COMPLETE AND VERIFIED
- P0 safety and control plane: COMPLETE AND VERIFIED
- P0.5 canonical contract freeze: COMPLETE AND VERIFIED
- P1 Supabase target registration: COMPLETE AND VERIFIED
- P1 Supabase migrations/RPC: COMPLETE AND VERIFIED (dev_test `epeddfdifckzzmskhdsz`)
- P2 onboarding design: **Hybrid A+C PUBLISHED IN GIT** (`0.2.0` / `1.1.0`)
- P2 child tables: **APPLIED AND VERIFIED on htl-factory-dev**
  - `onboarding_employees` applied (remote version `20260731193347`)
  - `inventory_submissions` applied (remote version `20260731193358`)
  - RLS enabled; zero policies; no SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE for anon/authenticated
  - Synthetic smoke passed; synthetic data deleted
  - `apply_authorized` returned to **false**
- P2 Make intake: **INACTIVE DEV OBJECTS EXIST — SYNTHETIC E2E BLOCKED**
  - Scenario `4852018` inactive; webhook `2785703`; connection `4834536`
  - Identity/blueprint inspected 2026-07-31; no GHL/ClickUp modules
  - Synthetic Form 1 E2E **not executed**: Make at 26 active / 43 total with no owner-named noncritical pause candidate
  - Secondary: live blueprint still hardcodes onboarding schema `1.0.0` and empty intake/config payloads (not contract `0.2.0` / schema `1.1.0` reported fields)
  - No scenario executions from this attempt; no synthetic DB rows created
  - GHL wiring still unauthorized; ClickUp still unauthorized
  - Forms 2/3 not built
- P2 overall: **NOT COMPLETE** (Make E2E + GHL gates open)
- P3 provisioning: NOT STARTED
- P4–P7: NOT STARTED

## Current Contract

- Contract version (live in Git): **0.2.0**
- Onboarding schema version (live in Git): **1.1.0**
- Registered Supabase project: htl-factory-dev / `epeddfdifckzzmskhdsz` / dev_test
- Migration apply authorized (config gate): **no**
- Child-table migrations applied to dev: **yes** (verified)
- Production migration apply authorized: no
- Sun Pool mutation authorized: no

## Active Gate

Child tables verified on `htl-factory-dev`. Form 1 Make scenario remains inactive. Synthetic E2E blocked on active-slot authorization (and ideally a blueprint bump for `0.2.0` / `1.1.0`). GHL / ClickUp / P3 remain unauthorized.

Next owner decision:

1. Name one specific Make scenario ID that may be temporarily paused to free an active slot for synthetic Form 1 E2E on `4852018` (or raise Make capacity). Prefer also authorizing a blueprint update to contract `0.2.0` / schema `1.1.0` before that run.
